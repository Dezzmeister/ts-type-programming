# Type Programming

Cool type-level programming in Typescript. This project requires https://github.com/Dezzmeister/TypeScript to be cloned in a sibling directory. This fork of the Typescript compiler removes the type instantiation limit so that some of the more complicated type functions in this project will work. This also makes it possible to construct an infinite type and hang the compiler.
